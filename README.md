# OntoTox, an ontological representation of chemotherapy toxicities 

OntoTox is an ontology designed to represent chemotherapy toxicities, its attributes and provenance. 
OntoTox integrates toxicities and grading information extracted from three heterogeneous sources: 
- EHR  questionnaires
- semi-structured tables
- free text  

In this repository, you will find examples of OntoTox instanciations in the "owl_files" directory. These instanciations has been generated with false patient data, located in the "data" directory. 

PROV-O ontology [[1]](#1) has been instantiated to encode provenance.
OntoTox has been implemented in owl using Owlready2 module [[2]](#2).
Data has been processed using QuickUMLS [[3]](#3), Stanza [[4]](#4) and PyMedExt annotators [[5]](#5).
